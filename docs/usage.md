# Usage

To use django-directed in a project, once installed via pip...

---

Within a Django project utilizing django-directed the graph, nodes, and edges are represented as distinct concrete models, and multiple types of graphs can be built within the same project. Likewise, within the database the graph, nodes, and edges are represented by separate tables.

Graphs within django-directed are configurable, and make use of model factories along with abstract Django models to allow multiple different types of graphs with limited repetition of code.
